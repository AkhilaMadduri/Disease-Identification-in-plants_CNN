# Disease-identification-in-plants_CNN

<h2><b> Abstract: </b></h2>
There are various types of diseases on the plant leaf that causes problem in development of crops. Human eyes are not so much stronger to see the leaf diseases so humans do not observe variation in the infected part of leaf. These diseases sometimes may not be visible to human eyes and they directly affecting to the crop. The automatic disease detection system is used to automatic detection and identify the diseased part on the leaf images and it classify plant leaf disease using image processing techniques.

By gathering the leaves and training them, we  use this  training data to  train our classifier and then output will be predicted with optimum accuracy. We use Convolution Neural Network(CNN) which comprises of different layers which are used for prediction. Some important steps are used for detection like featureextraction and for classification of images we are using CNN, Deep Learning. Proposed model helpsto reduce efforts or hard work of farmers for monitoring big farms and related diseases to farm and crops.
